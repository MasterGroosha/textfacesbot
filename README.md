# Textfaces bot for Telegram

This bot allows you to send cool text faces 
(also known as [kaomoji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticon#Japanese_style)) to any chat in Telegram 
using inline mode. Just type [@textfacesbot](https://t.me/textfacesbot) and add any text you wish.  
By default, kaomoji is placed **after** your text, however if you start your message with comma, kaomoji would 
be placed in front of your text.
